## Overview

Fury is a long-term project to create next-generation build tooling to address the greatest challenges of
building software in an ever-changing environment, while maintaining the predictability, reliability and
simplicity of builds.

## Features
- fully data-oriented model for builds
- builds may be defined in terms of sources or binary dependencies
- power to control a build and the builds of all its source dependencies
- advanced support for conflict resolution amongst dependencies
- intuitive command-line API, with visual interfaces available later (Milestone 3)
- hierarchical model of builds and build distribution
- support for compiling Scala 2.x, Scala 3, Scala.js and Java
- composable variants of builds, for generalized cross-building (Milestone 2)
- support for running Docker containers as part of a build (Milestone 2)
- compilation distributed over the network (Milestone 3)
- optionally external builds, shared independently of source code

## Release
